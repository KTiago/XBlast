# XBlast
XBlast is a multiplayer game similar to Bomberman coded in Java.

I coded this game with a partner as part of a programming course at the Federal Institue of Technology in Lausanne.

Use arrows to move, space bar to drop a bomb and shift to stop moving.

You can easily test the game by importing the project in your IDE, like eclipse. From then there are two versions of the program : the server, which must run on one machine, and the client which must run on various machines (up to 4). Run the main file of the server and choose the number of players, each player should run the main file of the client and insert the IP address of the host (server). When there is enough players, the game starts. 

GOOD LUCK !
